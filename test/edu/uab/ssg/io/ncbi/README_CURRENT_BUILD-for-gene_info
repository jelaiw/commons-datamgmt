GRCh37          The human genome assembly released on March 2, 2009 by
                the Genome Reference Consortium. GRCh37 is comprised
                of a 'primary assembly' and a set of 'alternate loci'.
                The primary assembly represents the assembled
                chromosomes, plus any unlocalized or unplaced sequence
                that represent the non-redundant, haploid
                assembly. The nine alternate loci represent regions
                for which there is large scale variation from the
                sequence in the primary assembly. For more details,
                see http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/genome/
                assembly/grc/human/index.shtml.
                This is the reference assembly for the nuclear genome.

Celera          Celera Genomics whole genome shotgun assembly (AADB),
                November 2001. This assembly included both WGS and BAC
                sequence data. 
HuRef           J Craig Venter Institute whole genome shotgun assembly
                (May 2007) (see http://www.jcvi.org/research/huref/). 
                This assembly represents a composite haploid version 
                of the diploid genome sequence from a single 
                individual (J. Craig Venter).

                Sick Children (Toronto) chromosome 7 assembly, (April
                2004). 
   
----------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: The sequence used to represent the human mitochondrion genome in
this build (NC_001807.4) is no longer current. After the genomic
sequences in this build were frozen, the accepted reference sequence
for the Homo sapiens mitochondrion was switched to be the rCRS/Mitomap
sequence, which is now available as the record NC_012920.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
