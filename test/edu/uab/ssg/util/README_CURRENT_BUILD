Label           Description
-----           -----------
GRCh37.p2       The human genome assembly released July 30 2010 by the 
                Genome Reference Consortium. The full GRCh37.p2 
		assembly is comprised of 12 assembly-units which have 
		the following labels:
	        Primary_Assembly
                ALT_REF_LOCI_1
                ALT_REF_LOCI_2
                ALT_REF_LOCI_3
                ALT_REF_LOCI_4
                ALT_REF_LOCI_5
                ALT_REF_LOCI_6
                ALT_REF_LOCI_7
                ALT_REF_LOCI_8
                ALT_REF_LOCI_9
		PATCHES
		non-nuclear
		
                The primary assembly represents the assembled 
		chromosomes, plus any unlocalized or unplaced sequence 
		that represent the non-redundant, haploid assembly. 
		The nine alternate loci represent regions for which 
		there is large scale variation from the sequence in 
		the primary assembly. The PATCHES assembly-unit 
		contain new alternate loci (novel patch) or regions 
		where the sequence was improved (fix patch). PATCHES 
		are minor updates to the assembly and will be 
		incorporated into the primary assembly or appropritate 
		alternative loci in the next version of the assembly. 
		For more details, see:
                http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/genome/
                assembly/grc/human/index.shtml. 
		The non-nuclear assembly-unit contains the NCBI 
		Reference Sequence (RefSeq) for the human 
		mitochondrion genome.

                The primary assembly and alternative loci are identical 
		in GRCh37 and GRCh37.p2.

	        GRCh37.p2 is the reference assembly.
	
Celera          Celera Genomics whole genome shotgun assembly 
                (AADB00000000.2, November 2001). This assembly includes 
		both WGS and BAC sequence data.
		
HuRef           J Craig Venter Institute whole genome shotgun assembly
                (ABBA00000000.1, May 2007). See:
		  http://www.jcvi.org/research/huref/). 
                This assembly represents a composite haploid version 
                of the diploid genome sequence from a single 
                individual (J. Craig Venter).

                Sick Children (Toronto) chromosome 7 assembly, (April
                2004).
